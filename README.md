## Classes

### Class 1: Hello Swift

We were talking about the basics of Swift programming language:

- Variables and **constants** (`var` and `let` keywords)
- `String`
- `Array` and `Dictionary` data types (value types)
- Optionals (`Int?`, `String?`, `if let ...` syntax, and so on)
- Control Flow (`if`, `for` and `while` loops, `switch` statement (üí™))
- Functions ‚Äì defining a function with parameters in Swift (`func` keyword), return value type, calling functions, etc.
- Classes ‚Äì defining a basic class, defining methods, class properties, initializers. We've also discussed inheritance in Swift, overriding methods and initializers.
- Enums!
- Structs
- Value Types vs Reference Types

To learn more, go through the [Swift](./Class1) playground.

### Class 2: SwiftUI 101

We were talking about the basics of SwiftUI:

- SwiftUI is a declarative UI framework
- `View` defines a piece of UI
- All views are build with defined in SwiftUI views (building blocks üß±)
- `Text` & `Image` - main views for displaying content
- You can apply multiple `ViewModifiers` to View. Order of modifiers has great meaning ‚ö†Ô∏è
- `VStack`, `HStack` and `ZStack` are basic containers to arrange multiple views
- ControlFlow - You can use `ForEach`, `if...else` and `switch` in View body
- ScrollView üìú
- GeometryReader it's one of the most powerful views in SwiftUI - use it wisely üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Views should be simple and readable

To learn more, go through the [example project](./Class2).

### Class 3: SwiftUI 102

We talked about data flow in SwiftUI:

- Data access as a Dependency
- Data should have one source of truth
- `@State` is source of truth
- Views are a function of state
- `@Binding` to write and read without ownership
- `@ObservedObject` or `@StateObject` for reference types
- `@EnvironmentObject` to read model from view hierarchy 
- `@Environment` to read values like disabled state or locale

To learn more, go through the [example project](./Class3).

### Class 4: Intermediate Swift & MVVM

We talked about advanced topics in Swift and MVVM architecture:

- 2 types of memory management - *Stack* and *Heap*
- ARC tells when memory can be free
- *Stack* is for value types
- *Heap* is for reference type
- Reference types can cause memory leaks
- Use `weak` or `unowned` reference to avoid the leak
- It is good to use some architecture for example MVVM
- Model - defines a business logic
- View - renders UI
- ViewModel - translates user actions to business actions and prepares data for the view
- The dependency should look like this: `View` ‚¨ÖÔ∏è `ViewModel` ‚¨ÖÔ∏è `Model`

To learn more, go through the [example MVVM project](./Class4).

### Class 5: Networking with async/await

We talked about Networking with async/await:

- To make a network call you will nee `URL`
- The default iOS object responsible for networking is `URLSession`
- To configure `URLSession` use `URLSessionConfiguration`
- You can always use predefined `URLSession.shared`
- `URLRequest` give possibility to set *HTTP* method or headers
- Methods that can throw an error must be marked with `throws`
- Such method must be called with `try`
- There are many was of handling errors `do {...} catch {...}`, `try?`, `try!`
- `Codable` protocol is great for parsing JSONs
- Async/await is swift language tool for handling concurrency
- The asynchronous work is called *Task*
- Task must be called with `await` and it's a suspend point 
- Methods that can be suspend must be marked with `async`

To learn more, go through the [example project](./Class5).

### Class 6: Lists and Navigation

We talked about displaying large amount of data and navigation in SwiftUI:

- SwiftUI manage to display large content by displaying only what is visible on the screen (+/- few)
- LazyV(H)Grid can display items in multiple columns(rows)
- GridItem defines how the column behaves (adaptive, flexible, fixed)
- List displays items in rows 
- List can be styled with ListStyle
- LazyV(H)Stack displays lazily items verticaly
- Both lazy stacks and grids can have pinnedView
- On iOS we have 3 types of navigation: [Hierarchical, Flat, Content-Driven](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/app-architecture/navigation/) 
- In SwiftUI we can perform push with `NavigationView` and `NavigationLink`
- To show modal use `.sheet()` modifier
- NavigationTitle is visible only when there is NavigationView somewhere in hierarchy

To learn more, go through the [example project](./Class6).
