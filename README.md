## Classes

### Class 1: Hello Swift

We were talking about the basics of Swift programming language:

- Variables and **constants** (`var` and `let` keywords)
- `String`
- `Array` and `Dictionary` data types (value types)
- Optionals (`Int?`, `String?`, `if let ...` syntax, and so on)
- Control Flow (`if`, `for` and `while` loops, `switch` statement (ðŸ’ª))
- Functions â€“ defining a function with parameters in Swift (`func` keyword), return value type, calling functions, etc.
- Classes â€“ defining a basic class, defining methods, class properties, initializers. We've also discussed inheritance in Swift, overriding methods and initializers.
- Enums!
- Structs
- Value Types vs Reference Types

To learn more, go through the [Swift](./Class1) playground.
